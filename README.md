## Project overview:

The purpose of the project was use bacterial data gathered from volunteers and put the data into a visualization identifying the top 10 bacterial species from their belly buttons.That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. 
The dashboard was designed for "Test Subject ID" and the visualizations display results on different charts:
- Demographic Information
- Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
- Belly Button Washing Frequency
- Bacteria Cultures Per Sample

## Results:

With the help of JavaScript, VS Code, Plotly, d3, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JSON and the process of writing the code, we created Belly Button Biodievsity Dashboard.
